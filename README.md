# PHP Test
In this test, you'll find a list of instructions in `routes/web.php`. Please fork this repo to your personal account and make any changes you wish.

The main files you'll need to touch are `routes/web.php` and `resources/views/show.blade.php`.

Upon completion of this and launching the project in an EC2 instance (per instructions in AWS test below), send us both the link to the launched project and to your github repo.

1. Create a key pair
2. Launch an EC2 instance
3. Login to that instance via ssh
4. Clone your git repo
5. Run the PHP app and serve requests
6. Securely send us the .pem file
